# Day 1

We did mostly setup work, created a google doc for working together, started writing what endpoints we want to create, started user stories, created github repo, created temporary erd need to change a little tomorrow, good day 1 planning.

# Day 2

Created README describing git workflow to avoid any git related problems, updated our ERD to track a few new tables we didnt have yesterday, UI Wireframe is looking good, added infrastructure to project as well as logging, finalized what endpoints we want through the project listed in document. Created issues for user stories so that everyone can start taking issues and working on it.

# Day 3

Migrated database according to our current version of the database in a code first environment. Everyone is taking tasks through issues on github. We are currently working out the kinks of using the automapper while also fixing up the linking tables for our database.

# Day 4

UI is starting to be made, most of our endpoints for our MVP are done, currently working through creation of User authentication and how that will affect our currently setup database. Started working on validations for every endpoint while also making good progress on testing.
