The Snake Game Database.

## Code & Naming Conventions

Case: Use PascalCase for classes, methods, and fields; camelCase for local variables.

---

Database name: `SGDB`

## Git Conventions

Commit messages: Follow Conventional Commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

Commit categories:
- `feat`: work on new features
- `fix`: bug fixes
- `refactor`: refactoring production code (not tests, build scripts, or docs)
- `style`: code style fixes
- `test`: tests
- `docs`: documentation (including code documentation)
- `chore`: build and project config, miscellaneous

Examples:
- `feat: add login endpoint`
- `fix: correct rating calculation`

Branch naming: Use <name/feature> format.

Examples: `vishesh/auth-login`, `shane/db-migrations`

## Git Workflow

1. Always sync with main before starting!!!
    - `git checkout main`
    - `git pull origin main`
2. Start work on your branch
    - `git checkout -b <name/feature>`
3. Make changes
    1. `git add .`
    2. `git commit -m "feat: describe your change here"`
    3. `git push -u origin <name/feature>` # only first push

Keep your branch updated with main:
1. `git checkout main`
2. `git pull origin main`
3. `git checkout <name/feature>`
4. `git merge main`

### **Important**

- Do not commit directly to main.
- Always create a feature branch and work there.
- All changes to main must come through a Pull Request.

## Handling Merge Conflicts

If a conflict occurs during merge:

1. Open the conflicting file(s) and fix the code manually.
2. Stage the resolved file(s): `git add <file>`
3. Commit the merge resolution: `git commit`
4. Push your changes: `git push origin <name/feature>`

## Pull Requests

Open a Pull Request into main when your feature is ready.

At least one reviewer must approve.

Squash & merge to keep history clean.

## Quick Reference

New branch: `git checkout -b <name/feature>`

Switch branch: `git checkout <branch>`

Sync with main:
- `git checkout main`
- `git pull origin main`
- `git checkout <branch>`
- `git merge main`

Commit: `git commit -m "feat: add X"`

Push: `git push origin <branch>`
